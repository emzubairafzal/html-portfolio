    <h2>Project Highlights</h2>
    <p>
      During my tenure at Wanclouds Inc in Islamabad, Pakistan, I had the privilege of working as a Software Engineer. I was responsible for developing and managing microservices using Flask, APIFlask, FastAPI, Django, and SQLAlchemy. Additionally, I played a pivotal role in implementing workflows for backup and restore of VPC infrastructure and GKE clusters, showcasing my proficiency in cloud-based technologies. My portfolio includes projects like VPC+ and Multi Cloud Disaster Recovery as a Service, which required me to employ technologies like Flask, SQLAlchemy, and REST API to provide cutting-edge solutions for multi-cloud management.

      These experiences have shaped me into a passionate, dedicated, and well-rounded software developer, and I'm excited to bring my expertise to your next tech endeavor. Let's collaborate and bring your vision to life!
